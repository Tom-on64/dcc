# Dumb C Compiler

DCC (or **D**umb **C** **C**ompiler) is a custom C compiler for x86\_64 MacOS.
I wrote this to learn how to write a compiler without having to design a language for it.
I'll use what i learn in this to write a compiler for my own language, [Neon](https://github.com/Tom-on64/neon).
